# Understanding localStorage and sessionStorage in JavaScript

In JavaScript, both `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` are built-in web APIs that allow you to store data in a user's browser. They are part of the Web Storage API. The key difference is that `localStorage` persists across browser sessions, while `sessionStorage` only lasts for the duration of the page session.

## Key Features

### localStorage
- **Persistence**: Data persists even after the browser is closed and reopened.
- **Storage Limit**: Typically 5-10 MB per domain.
- **Data Format**: Stores data as strings; use `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()` for non-string data.

### sessionStorage
- **Persistence**: Data is cleared when the tab or browser window is closed.
- **Storage Limit**: Similar to `localStorage`.
- **Scope**: Available only for the specific tab or window.

## Basic Operations for both localStorage and sessionStorage

### Set Item

```javascript
localStorage.setItem("username", "Bhadri");
sessionStorage.setItem("sessionUser", "Alice");
```

### Get Item

```javascript
let username = localStorage.getItem("username");
let sessionUser = sessionStorage.getItem("sessionUser");
```

### Remove Item

```javascript
localStorage.removeItem("username");
sessionStorage.removeItem("sessionUser");
```

### Clear All

```javascript
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
```

### Example: Storing Complex Data

```javascript
// Storing an object in localStorage
localStorage.setItem("user", JSON.stringify({ name: "Bhadri", age: 30 }));

// Retrieving and parsing the object
let user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("user"));
console.log(user.name);  // Output: "Bhadri"
```

### Limitations

- **Security**: Both `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` are accessible to any script running on the same domain, so do not store sensitive information.
- **Synchronous**: Operations are synchronous, which can block the main thread if large data sets are used.
- **Size Limitations**: While they provide more storage than cookies, the data size is limited.

## Conclusion

Use `localStorage` when you need data persistence across sessions. Use `sessionStorage` for temporary session-specific data. Always ensure you know the limitations and risks of using these storage mechanisms.
